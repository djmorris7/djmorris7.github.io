Hi, I'm Dylan, a second year PhD candidate in the discipline of mathematics at the University of Adelaide. I'm doing my PhD under the excellent supervision of my principal supervisor [Dr Andrew Black](https://researchers.adelaide.edu.au/profile/andrew.black) and co-supervisor [Dr John Maclean](https://researchers.adelaide.edu.au/profile/john.maclean).

My research interests lie in the modelling of biological processes which makes extensive use of stochastic and probabilistic methods. My research draws on a number of methods from applied mathematics, statistics, and scientific programming. A large component of my work looks at the development of efficient mathematical and computational methods for fitting complex models which eases the use of such models (reducing the reliance on super computers and programming languages like C++ and Rust). My PhD is the manifestation of these interests and focuses on the modelling of what happens once you get infected with a virus. These so-called within-host processes seek to capture the dynamics of infectious agents that have entered into ones system. In comparison to between-host (or transmission) models, our understanding of fitting and working with within-host dynamics is much simpler. This is a result in part due to the massive number of cells being modelledâ€”often resulting in simpler models being used as stochastic models require a large amount of compute. As such the models most used, are often simple piece-wise linear models which hides away some of the biological processes at play. The first paper from my PhD looks at how we can incorporate stochasticity into a large population model without the need for stochastic simulations.

Over the last 6 years I've worn many different hats and done a variety of things, the highlights of which are provided in the [Professional Activities](/_pages/professional_activities/) tab. Publications arising from my research are available over at [Publications](/_pages/publications/). Throughout my studies I have also been a teaching assistant for a wide variety of courses and you can also see these (both past and present) over at [Teaching](/_pages/teaching/). Open source code for projects, bits, and pieces are available over at my [GitHub](https://github.com/djmorris7).

If you're interested in my work or have any questions, please don't hesitate to get in touch with me, I'm always happy to chat about my work and see what others are up to.
