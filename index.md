Hi, I'm Dylan, I'm in the final 18 months of my PhD in the discipline of mathematics at the University of Adelaide. I'm doing my PhD under the excellent supervision of [Dr Andrew Black](https://researchers.adelaide.edu.au/profile/andrew.black) (principal), [Dr John Maclean](https://researchers.adelaide.edu.au/profile/john.maclean) and [Dr Lauren Kennedy](https://researchers.adelaide.edu.au/profile/lauren.a.kennedy).

My research interests lie in the modelling of biological processes, making extensive use of stochastic and probabilistic methods. My research draws on a number of methods from across applied mathematics, statistics, and scientific programming. A major focus of my work is in the development of efficient mathematical and computational methods for fitting complex models, easing the use of such models (reducing the reliance on super computers and programming languages like C++ and Rust).

Over my postgraduate degrees I've worn many different hats and done a variety of things, the highlights of which are provided in the [Professional Activities](/_pages/professional_activities/) tab. Publications arising from my research are available over at [Publications](/_pages/publications/). I've also been involved in a decent amount of teaching over a wide variety of courses and you can also see these (both past and present) over at [Teaching](/_pages/teaching/). Open source code for projects, bits, and pieces are available over at my [GitHub](https://github.com/djmorris7).

If you're interested in my work or have any questions, please don't hesitate to get in touch with me, I'm always happy to chat about research and see what others are up to.
