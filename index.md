## About me

I'm a PhD candidate in the discipline of mathematics at the University of Adelaide. My research interests lie in the practical modelling of biological processes which makes extensive use of stochastic and probabilistic methods. My research is highly interdisciplinary and a large component of my work is the development of efficient methods for fitting complex models.

My PhD is the manifestation of these interests and focuses on the modelling of what happens once you get infected with a virus. In comparison to between-host (or transmission) models, our understanding of within-host dynamics and models is in the early stages. This is a result in part due to the massive number of cells being modelledâ€”often resulting in simpler models being used as stochastic models require a large amount of compute. The first paper from my PhD looks at how we can incorporate stochasticity into a large population model without the need for stochastic simulations.

Over the last 6 years I've done a range of different things and some highlights are provided in [Professional Activities](/professional_activities). Publications arising from my research are available in [Publications](/publications). Throughout my studies I have also been a teaching assistant for a wide variety of courses and you can also see these in [Professional Activities](/professional_activities).
