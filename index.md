Hi, I'm Dylan, and I'm in the final year of my PhD in Mathematics at the University of Adelaide. I'm fortunate to be supervised by [Dr Andrew Black](https://researchers.adelaide.edu.au/profile/andrew.black) (principal), [Dr John Maclean](https://researchers.adelaide.edu.au/profile/john.maclean), and [Dr Lauren Kennedy](https://researchers.adelaide.edu.au/profile/lauren.a.kennedy).

My research focuses on modelling biological processes using stochastic and probabilistic methods. It integrates techniques from applied mathematics, statistics, and scientific programming. A key aspect of my work involves developing efficient mathematical and computational methods for fitting complex models, with an emphasis on accessibility—reducing the reliance on supercomputers and low-level programming languages like C++ and Rust. I'm currently working on developing methods for merging within-host and between-host models of infectious diseases, with a focus on influenza and COVID-19.

Throughout my postgraduate candidature, I've worked in a variety of roles, with highlights listed under [Professional Activities](/_pages/professional_activities/). You can find publications stemming from my research under [Publications](/_pages/publications/). Open-source code and project contributions can be found on my [GitHub](https://github.com/djmorris7). I've also had the opportunity to teach many courses in a range of capacities (course coordinator, tutor, marker) at the University of Adelaide, detailed under [Teaching](/_pages/teaching/).

If you're interested in my research or have any questions, feel free to reach out—I’m always happy to discuss ideas and learn about others' work.
