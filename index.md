Hi, I'm Dylan, and I'm in the final year of my PhD in Mathematics at the University of Adelaide. I'm fortunate to be supervised by [Dr Andrew Black](https://researchers.adelaide.edu.au/profile/andrew.black) (principal) and [Dr Lauren Kennedy](https://researchers.adelaide.edu.au/profile/lauren.a.kennedy).

My research focuses on modelling biological processes using stochastic and probabilistic methods. It integrates techniques from applied mathematics, statistics, and scientific programming. A key aspect of my work involves developing efficient mathematical and computational methods for fitting complex within-host and multi-scale epidemic models, with an emphasis on accessibility—reducing the reliance on supercomputers and low-level programming languages. I'm currently working on developing methods for merging within-host and between-host models of respiratory infectious diseases (Covid-19 and Influenzas), while accounting for stochasticity in each process. 

<!-- My work is mostly programmed in [Julia](https://julialang.org/) as it more naturally translates mathematical models into code while yielding a great performance making it a great language for scientific computing. I also spend a fair amount of time working in [Python](https://www.python.org/) for less computationally intensive tasks and data analysis. -->

Throughout my postgraduate candidature, I've worked in a variety of roles, with highlights listed under [Professional Activities](/_pages/professional_activities/). You can find publications stemming from my research under [Publications](/_pages/publications/). Open-source code and project contributions can be found on my [GitHub](https://github.com/djmorris7). I've also had the opportunity to teach many courses in a range of capacities (course coordinator, project supervisor, tutor, and marker) at the University of Adelaide, detailed under [Teaching](/_pages/teaching/).

If you're interested in my research or have any questions, feel free to reach out—I’m always happy to discuss ideas and learn about others' work.
