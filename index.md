Hi, I'm Dylan, and I'm in the final year of my PhD in Mathematics at the University of Adelaide. I'm fortunate to be supervised by [Dr Andrew Black](https://researchers.adelaide.edu.au/profile/andrew.black) (principal), [Dr John Maclean](https://researchers.adelaide.edu.au/profile/john.maclean), and [Dr Lauren Kennedy](https://researchers.adelaide.edu.au/profile/lauren.a.kennedy).

My research focuses on modelling biological processes using stochastic and probabilistic methods. It integrates techniques from applied mathematics, statistics, and scientific programming. A key aspect of my work involves developing efficient mathematical and computational methods for fitting complex models, with an emphasis on accessibility—reducing the reliance on supercomputers and low-level programming languages like C++ and Rust.

Throughout my postgraduate studies, I've taken on a variety of roles and projects, with highlights listed under the [Professional Activities tab](/_pages/professional_activities/). You can find publications stemming from my research under [Publications](/_pages/publications/). I've also had the opportunity to teach several level II and III courses at the University of Adelaide, which are detailed under [Teaching](/_pages/teaching/). Additionally, open-source code and project contributions can be found on my [GitHub](https://github.com/djmorris7).

If you're interested in my research or have any questions, feel free to reach out—I’m always happy to discuss ideas and learn about others' work.
