### Research assistant

Over most of 2021 and into 2022 I worked as a research assistant on a couple projects relating to COVID-19.

- COVID-19 federal forecasting
  - Code is available [here](https://github.com/djmorris7/covid19-forecasting-aus) (note that this cannot be run as data-sources are no longer available and this repository largely acts as an archive now).
  - Worked with teams all around Australia to produce weekly forecasts of COVID-19 cases for the Australian Federal government.
  - Took on a mature codebase that has been worked on by multiple collaborators and has been consistently updated since March 2020 as the pandemic has progressed.
  - Running weekly forecasts for COVID-19 cases, maintaining, and improving the codebase, and implementing novel developments for inclusion of vaccination data and handling of co-circulating strains.
- First Few X (FFX) COVID-19
  - Assessed the assumptions of a final size based epidemic model which.
  - Translated the codebase I inherited from MATLAB to Julia to obtain around a 50x improvement in runtimes.

### Teaching

During my MPhil and PhD candidature I have worked in a casual capacity at the University of Adelaide. During this time I worked a variety of roles across all levels of undergraduate courses. The most notable of which was working as a stand-in lecturer for Computational Bayesian Statistics III in Semester 2 of 2022.

I've tutored for the following courses:

- Statistical practice I
- Statistics and Numerical methods II
- Computational Bayesian Statistics III
- Master of Data Science (Research/Industry Project B)
- Mathematics IA, IB and IM

I've been a marker for:

- Statistical practice I
- Statistics and Numerical methods II
- Computational Bayesian Statistics III
- Master of Data Science (Research/Industry Project B)
- Mathematics IA, IB and IM
- Probability and Statistics II
- Random Processes III
- Statistical modelling and inference II
- Statistical Analysis and Modelling I

### Workshops and outreach

In 2022 I helped to develop a **Data Science Coffee Club** at the University of Adelaide for post-graduate students in Mathematics. We developed a series of sessions for giving a crash course into the following LaTeX, Git and Github, code practices, debugging, plotting, note-taking practices and more. In 2023 we refined this session and rebranded as **HDR Skills Workshop**. This is a more streamlined version of the sessions with an emphasis on encouraging collaboration and development of incoming students.
