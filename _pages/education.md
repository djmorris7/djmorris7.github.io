Here's my education history and some details of my research projects throughout my MPhil and PhD candidatures.

## Doctor of Philosophy (in progress) [2022 — current]

My PhD is the manifestation of my research interests and focuses on the modelling of what happens once you get infected with a virus. These so-called within-host processes seek to capture the dynamics of infectious agents that have entered into ones system. In comparison to between-host (or transmission) models, our understanding of fitting and working with within-host dynamics is much simpler. This is a result in part due to the massive number of cells being modelled—often resulting in simpler models being used as stochastic models require a large amount of compute. As such the models most used, are often simple piece-wise linear models which hides away some of the biological processes at play. The first paper from my PhD looks at how we can incorporate stochasticity into a large population model without the need for stochastic simulations.

Papers arising from my PhD:

distributions for stochastic population models. Journal of Mathematical Biology, 89, 33, [10.1007/s00285-024-02132-6](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00285-024-02132-6?utm_source=rct_congratemailt&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=oa_20240812&utm_content=10.1007%2Fs00285-024-02132-6).

## Master of Philosophy (completed) [2019 — 2021]

I completed my M.Phil in 2021 with my thesis titled [Inference on historical Ebola outbreaks using hierarchical models: a particle filtering approach](https://hdl.handle.net/2440/132642). This work looked at how we can model outbreaks of Ebola efficiently by using importance sampling in particle filters. This methodology allows realisations of a continuous-time Markov chain to be simulated that are consistent with two time-series of (partial) observations of the outbreak. Ebola served as a great case study since it is a disease where it's relatively easy to see when someone gets sick and dies as a result of it.
