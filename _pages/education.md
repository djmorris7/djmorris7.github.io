I completed my M.Phil in 2021 with my thesis titled [Inference on historical Ebola outbreaks using hierarchical models: a particle filtering approach](https://hdl.handle.net/2440/132642). This work looked at how we can model outbreaks of Ebola efficiently by using importance sampling in particle filters. This methodology allows realisations of a continuous-time Markov chain to be simulated that are consistent with two time-series of (partial) observations of the outbreak. Ebola served as a great case study since it is a disease where it's relatively easy to see when someone gets sick and dies as a result of it.
