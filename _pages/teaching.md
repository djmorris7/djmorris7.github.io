<!-- # Teaching -->

During my MPhil and PhD candidature I have worked in a casual capacity at the University of Adelaide. During this time I worked a variety of roles across all levels of undergraduate courses. The most notable of which was working as a stand-in lecturer for Computational Bayesian Statistics III in semester 2 of 2022 and as its course coordinator in semester 2 of 2023.

## Current

Currently I am tutoring for Probability and Statistics II and supervising 2 groups of students for the Master of Data Science Research/Industry Project A and B. I am also marking for these courses as well as Applied Probability III.
