During my MPhil and PhD candidature I have worked in a casual capacity at the University of Adelaide. During this time I worked a variety of roles across all levels of undergraduate courses. The most notable of which was working as a stand-in lecturer for Computational Bayesian Statistics III in semester 2 of 2022 and as its course coordinator in semester 2 of 2023. 

## Current teaching 

Currently I am coordinating Probability and Statistics II and supervising 2 groups of students for the Master of Data Science Research/Industry Project A and B.

Coming up in Semester 2 of 2024 I will be course coordinator for [Random processes III](https://www.adelaide.edu.au/course-outlines/101488/1/sem-2/).

## Experience
