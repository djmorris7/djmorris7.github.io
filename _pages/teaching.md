During my MPhil and PhD candidature I have worked in a casual capacity at the University of Adelaide. During this time I worked a variety of roles across all levels of undergraduate courses. The most notable of which was working as a stand-in lecturer for Computational Bayesian Statistics III in Semester 2 of 2022.

I've tutored for the following courses:

- Statistical practice I
- Statistics and Numerical methods II
- Computational Bayesian Statistics III
- Master of Data Science (Research/Industry Project B)
- Mathematics IA, IB and IM
