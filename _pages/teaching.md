During my MPhil and PhD candidature I have worked in a casual capacity at the University of Adelaide. I have worked in many different capacities over my early teaching career with a variety of roles across all levels of undergraduate courses. The most notable of my experiences have been working as a stand-in lecturer for Computational Bayesian Statistics III in semester 2 of 2022 and as its course coordinator in semester 2 of 2023, doing the same for Probability and Statistics II in semester 1 of 2024, and being the course coordinator for Random processes III in semester 2 of 2024. 

## Current teaching

Currently I am the course coordinator for [Random processes III](https://www.adelaide.edu.au/course-outlines/101488/1/sem-2/).

## Experience
