During my MPhil and PhD candidature at the University of Adelaide, I have worked in various casual teaching roles, gaining experience across all levels of undergraduate courses. Notably, I served as a stand-in lecturer for Computational Bayesian Statistics III in Semester 2 of 2022 and later as its course coordinator in Semester 2 of 2023. I held similar roles for Probability and Statistics II in Semester 1 of 2024 and as course coordinator for Random Processes III in Semester 2 of 2024.

## Current teaching
 
In Semester 1 of 2025 I will be the course coordinator for [Probability and Statistics II](https://www.adelaide.edu.au/course-outlines/104837/1/sem-1/).
