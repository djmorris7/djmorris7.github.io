During my MPhil and PhD candidatures at the University of Adelaide, I have gained extensive experience in casual teaching roles across all levels of undergraduate courses. Notably, I have undertaken course coordination and stand-in course coordination responsibilities for several courses. Additionally, I have supervised several cohorts of students in the Master of Data Science Industry Research program.

## Current teaching

In Semester 1 of 2025 I am the course coordinator for [Probability and Statistics II](https://www.adelaide.edu.au/course-outlines/104837/1/sem-1/). 

## Experience

### Course coordination / supervision

- Course coordinator for [Random processes III](https://www.adelaide.edu.au/course-outlines/101488/1/sem-2/) (2024, Semester 2).
- Course coordinator (in second half of semester) for [Probability and Statistics II](https://www.adelaide.edu.au/course-outlines/104837/1/sem-1/) (2024, Semester 1).
- Course coordinator (in second half of semester) for [Computational Bayesian Statistics III](https://www.adelaide.edu.au/course-outlines/110034/1/sem-2/2023/) (2022, 2023, Semester 2).
- Supervising students for the [Master of Data Science (Research/Industry Project A and B)](https://www.adelaide.edu.au/course-outlines/111081/1/tri-2/) (2023, 2024).
